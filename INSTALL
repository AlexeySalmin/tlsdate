Building and install of tlsdate should be as easy as:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Cleaning is the usual:

  make clean

To make an unsigned Debian package:

  git checkout debian-master
  make deb

To make a Debian source package:

  git checkout master
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure && make debian_orig
  git checkout debian-master
  fakeroot debian/rules clean
  cd ../
  dpkg-source -b tlsdate

Example of how to build a package for Debian:

  # First build the source package above
  scp tlsdate_* dixie.torproject.org:~/src/debian-builds/
  ~/bin/sbuild-stuff tlsdate_0.0.1-1.dsc
  # Download or build the package locally
  # and sign the .changes or .dsc file
  debsign -k 0xD81D840E tlsdate_0.0.1-1.changes
