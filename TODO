Here is a nice list of things to do to improve tlsdate:


 1)  hack the client handshake to not leak the clock to the server
       set it to all zeros or something cute or something random

 3)  add HTTP GET request to avoid network fingerprinting
 5)  daemonize and regularly slam the clock
 6)  skew the clock rather than slamming it
 7)  drop privs earlier
 9)  make this work with Tor in a proxy safe manner (no DNS mode)
       This should work with torsocks, does it? Audit results please!
11)  verification of remote certificate for Tor nodes
13)  account for servers that do not send UTC (Microsoft sends local time)
14)  port to nss, gnutls, yassl and other libraries
15)  starttls support (smtp, pop, imap, ftp, xmpp)
16)  ensure that 32bit time isn't near wrapping time on 32bit systems
17)  find others to audit it - we need more eyes!
18)  cache recent time to /tmp/tlsdate_stamp or something
19)  override client time
       Add a way to read the cache of the last updated time and read that as
       the new epoch.
20)  Add verification of remote servers by DANE/CAA DNSSEC protected records
21)  Integrate Chrome's CRL list into tlsdate
22)  Block revoked or bad certs such as MD5 inc. and others.
24)  Add OCSP check option
25)  Block weak signature algorithms
26)  Hard code block list of known horrible certs (extract from Chrome/FF)
28)  Check that extended key usage is empty, or includes TLS Server Auth
29)  extract the SubjectPublicKeyInfo from the certificates; match against
     public keys
30)  Check CN and/or SAN field to match against wild card certs
31)  Fetch HTTP over TLS to parse date field and confirm sync with the tls date

Patches welcome!
