Here is a nice list of things to do to improve tlsdate:

 0)  autoconf the project
       move code into src/
       move configs into configs/

 1)  hack the client handshake to not leak the clock to the server
       set it to all zeros or something cute or something random

 2)  allow users to pass certs for custom verification
 3)  add HTTP GET request to avoid network fingerprinting
 5)  daemonize and regularly slam the clock
 6)  skew the clock rather than slamming it
 7)  drop privs earlier
 8)  audit the code for show stopping bugs
 9)  make this work with Tor in a proxy safe manner (no DNS mode)
10)  pin SSL certs for racket mode
11)  verification of remote certificate for Tor nodes
12)  ensure remote time is grater than COMPILE_DATE and less than 2**32
       says crash during code review
13)  account for servers that do not send UTC (Microsoft sends local time)
14)  port to nss, gnutls, yassl and other libraries
15)  starttls support (smtp, pop, imap, ftp, xmpp)

Patches welcome!
