0.0.2 XXX
  Add '-n' and '--dont-set-clock' option to fetch but not set time
  Add '-V' and '--showtime' option to display remote time
  Add '-t' and '--timewarp' option
    If the local clock is before RECENT_COMPILE_DATE; we set the clock to the
    RECENT_COMPILE_DATE. If the local clock is after RECENT_COMPILE_DATE, we
    leave the clock alone. Clock setting is performed as the first operation
    and will impact certificate verification. Specifically, this option is
    helpful if on first boot, the local system clock is set back to the era
    of Disco and Terrible Hair. This should ensure that 
    X509_V_ERR_CERT_NOT_YET_VALID or X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED are not
    encountered because of a broken RTC or the lack of a local RTC; we assume
    that tlsdate is recompiled yearly and that all certificates are otherwise
    considered valid.
  Update usage documentation
  Move {*.c,h} into src/
  Move *.1 into man/
  Update TODO list to reflect desired changes
  Update AppArmor profile to restrict {tlsdate,tlsdate-helper}
  Update AUTHORS file to include a new email address
